We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health.

Established in 1805, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (the NYC Health Department) is the oldest and largest health department in the country. Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â from New York Cityâs yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health.

Division and Job Description: The New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) is expanding home visiting in NYC and streamlining how providers, organizations, and community residents can access quality home-visiting services.

Racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic inequities create disparate outcomes in certain neighborhoods as compared with the rest of the city, and providing services beginning in the prenatal through postpartum period is vital to improving these outcomes. In addition, recent attention to inequities in maternal morbidity and mortality, especially in New York City, points to the need for more respectful maternity care and greater agency for people during childbirth, both of which the program's staff will facilitate, in partnership with NYC doula organizations. DOHMH's New Family Home Visits (NFHV) Initiative will serve families from pregnancy through the postpartum period. A subset of families will also be offered labor and delivery support by a certified doula. NFHV incorporates a strong mental-health and chronic-disease focus, including screening for diabetes, hypertension, maternal depression, and anxiety, along with referrals to needed services. The citywide program will begin in Brooklyn, offering home visits to more than 2,900 first-time expectant parents. of those.

Our mission is to protect and improve the health of all New Yorkers, in service of a vision of a city in which all New Yorkers can realize their full health potential, regardless of who they are, how old they are, where they are from, or where they live.   As a world-renowned public health agency with a history of building transformative public health programming and infrastructure, innovating in science and scholarship to advance public health knowledge, and responding to urgent public health crises â from New York Cityâs yellow fever outbreak in 1822, to the COVID-19 pandemic â we are a hub for public health innovation, expertise, and programs, and services. We serve as the population health strategist, and policy, and planning authority for the City of New York, while also having a vast impact on national and international public policy, including programs and services focused on food and nutrition, anti-tobacco support, chronic disease prevention, HIV/AIDS treatment, family and child health, environmental health, mental health, and racial and social justice work, among others.   Our Agencyâs five strategic priorities, building off a recently-completed strategic planning process emerging from the COVID-19 emergency, are:  1) To re-envision how the Health Department prepares for and responds to health emergencies, with a focus on building a âresponse-readyâ organization, with faster decision-making, transparent public communications, and stronger surveillance and bridges to healthcare systems 2) Address and prevent chronic and diet-related disease, including addressing rising rates of childhood obesity and the impact of diabetes, and transforming our food systems to improve nutrition and enhance access to healthy foods  3) Address the second pandemic of mental illness including: reducing overdose deaths, strengthening our youth mental health systems, and supporting people with serious mental illness  4) Reduce black maternal mortality and make New York a model city for womenâs health  5) Mobilize against and combat the health impacts of climate change   Our 7,000-plus team members bring extraordinary diversity to the work of public health. True to our value of equity as a foundational element of all of our work, and a critical foundation to achieving population health impact in New York City, the NYC Health Department has been a leader in recognizing and dismantling racismâs impacts on the health of New Yorkers and beyond. In 2021, the NYC Board of Health declared racism as a public health crisis. With commitment to advance anti-racist public health practices that dismantle systems that perpetuate inequitable power, opportunity and access, the NYC Health Department continues to work in and with communities and community organizations to increase their access to health services and decrease avoidable health outcomes.  PROGRAM AND JOB DESCRIPTION:  The Division of Center for Health Equity & Community Wellness (CHECW) uses a racial and social justice approach to eliminate health inequities for those who are most marginalized in New York City and to reduce overall premature mortality from the leading causes of preventable death with the vision that every New Yorker will live in a thriving neighborhood with equitable access to resources that help support healthy individuals and communities.  This division unifies and strengthens the Department's line of work directed at eliminating racial inequities for preventable health conditions, which are rooted in historical and contemporary injustices and discrimination, including racism.  CHECW's aim is to eliminate racial iniquities resulting in premature mortality, with a focus on chronic disease, by addressing the social and environmental factors that impact health. The goal of this renewed approach is to increase placed-based investment in priority neighborhoods with community programming and services based on epidemiology, influence and leverage the health system to promote whole person care; and intensify the agency's approach to tackle big salt and sugar, big tobacco, the built environment and other determinants of health.   The Bureau of Harlem Neighborhood Health (Harlem BNH) supports the agency's mission to protect and promote the health of all New Yorkers. Harlem BNH focuses on the structural and root causes of health disparity outcomes and develops programs to address these outcomes with input from partners and residents.  Addressing the social determinants of health (SDOH), is a key focus point and is enshrined in programs such as the Harlem Health Advocacy Partnership and the Asthma Counselor Program.  Other Bureau offerings include a variety of programs and activities focused on the health and wellness of Harlem residents.  The Harlem Bureau also houses the East and Central Harlem Neighborhood Health Action Center, which is a key part of the NYC's effort to promote health equity and reduce health disparities in the neighborhood.
